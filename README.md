# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

Welcome to my implementation of the classic "rock paper scissors" game, also known as "jak en poy" in the Philippines. This project serves as both a practical exercise in JavaScript programming and an opportunity to explore web development concepts.

You can play the game [here](https://krig6.github.io/jak-en-poy-game/).

## How It's Made

This project is built primarily with JavaScript and utilizes HTML and CSS for the user interface. I've incorporated functions, event listeners, and user interface elements to create an interactive gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. Visit the [game link](https://krig6.github.io/jak-en-poy-game/) in your web browser.
2. Click "Start Game" to begin.
3. Select your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding icon.
4. After each selection, the computer will randomly choose its move, and the outcome of the round will be displayed.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the game ends after five rounds.
6. A message will appear indicating whether you've won or lost the game.

## Learning Path

Throughout the development of this project, I've deepened my understanding of JavaScript functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation. By implementing game logic and user interface elements, I've honed my skills in creating interactive web applications.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to further enhance this project by:

- Improving the user interface with animations and transitions.
- Implementing multiplayer functionality for gaming with friends online.
- Exploring additional game variations or modes.
- Continuing my journey as a web developer, I aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts and frameworks to create even more dynamic and engaging web applications.
