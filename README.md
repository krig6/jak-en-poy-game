# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

Simple and grade-school classic "rock paper scissors" or "jak en poy" in the Philippines. A game of chance where players can challenge their luck against the computer. Through this project, I aimed to solidify my understanding of Javascript functions while also gaining practical experience with web development.

## How It's Made:

This project was created with Javascript, following the guidance and courses from The Odin Project. As an IT graduate who had previously worked in the travel industry, I sought to explore programming and transition into a career aligned with my academic background.

## How to play

1. Open Javascript console Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) in your web browser.
2. Click 'ok' when prompted with the message 'Try your luck?'
3. When prompted, input your choice: 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'.
4. After each round, your choice and computer's choice will be printed, including the result of the round.
5. You can play for 5 rounds and an alert will show if you won or lost.

## Learning Path

Starting with basics, familiarizing myself with Javascript syntax, data types, functions and understanding errors which are essential in creating this project. For instance, I utilized control flow statements to implement game logic, such as determining the winner in a rock-paper-scissors game.

## Future Endeavors

As I continue my journey to becoming a proficient web developer. I plan to expand this project by implementing graphical user interface, additional features and improve existing functions. I will also explore frameworks and libraries and aim to complete The Odin Project.
